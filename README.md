# Hi there, I am Arun.

I’m a backend-focused full-stack developer based in Kathmandu, Nepal, with a strong interest in building efficient and scalable systems. I primarily enjoy working on backend technologies, and I’ve also started learning Python and the fundamentals of AI/ML as I explore how these fields might shape the future of software.

I’m still learning, experimenting, and improving every day, with the goal of becoming a software engineer capable of designing reliable and performant backend solutions.

Thank you for stopping by and feel free to explore the site and take a look at the projects I’ve built along the way.
